  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Metropolis
      fonts:
        - asset: assets\fonts\Metropolis-ExtraBold.otf
          weight: 800
        - asset: assets\fonts\Metropolis-Bold.otf
          weight: 700
        - asset: assets\fonts\Metropolis-Regular.otf
        - asset: assets\fonts\Metropolis-Medium.otf
          weight: 500
        - asset: assets\fonts\Metropolis-SemiBold.otf
          weight: 600
  # The following line makes the package use the specified fonts.
